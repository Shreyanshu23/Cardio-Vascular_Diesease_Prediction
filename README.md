# Cardio-Vascular_Diesease_Prediction

Cardiovascular diseases encompass a range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke. Early detection of risk factors can help in implementing interventions to prevent or manage these conditions effectively. This project employs machine learning algorithms to analyze various health parameters and predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease occurrence in individuals.

The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models is heart.csv . It contains anonymized patient data including demographic information, vital signs, and medical history. Before using the dataset, it was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.

Several machine learning algorithms were explored and evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting cardiovascular disease risk. The following methods were implemented:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature normalization, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature selection: Identifying relevant features using techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance.
Model training: Training various machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting classifiers.
Model evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Modify the code as needed for your own dataset or experiment with different machine learning algorithms.

The performance of the machine learning models was evaluated using cross-validation and held-out test sets. The results demonstrated promising predictive accuracy, with certain models outperforming others in terms of specific evaluation metrics. Detailed results and analysis are provided in the Jupyter notebooks within the notebooks/ directory.
